# DuckStation - LightGun Edition
You need to apply Justifier patch for some of the game
Those are included in the rlz zip.

Lightgun must be used in joystick mode, using guncon relative aiming

Outputs support either with a direct connection for Gun4IR or with MameHooker.

For Gun4IR recoil :  go to controller settings, your guncon Port, Settings and you should see Gun4Ir Com port option
For Mamehooker : Settings, General, Enable MameHooker checkbox (you need .NET 8 because i use a third party app to make it work)

Also added some No Flash Gun cheat that were not build in duckstation.
