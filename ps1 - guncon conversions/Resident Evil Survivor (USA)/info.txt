### General info ###

This patch is made for US release of Resident Evil: Survivor and here's what it does:

1. Fixed broken music in one of the areas in the factory, that particular track was broken by those who mastered disc image for production and it is not a bad dump on your side.
2. Restored light gun support, which was removed from US release for some very dumb reason.
3. Disabled modchip detection code for your convenience.

So, now US version of this very atmospheric game is presented to you in its non-broken state, like it should have been released originally.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to fix atrocious storyline. But hey, what can we do? Sigh...
